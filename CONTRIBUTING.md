## How to Contribute

We categorize contributions into three main types: Bug Reports, Feature Suggestions, and Code Submissions.

### üêõ Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in the HMS, please help us by reporting it!

1.  **Check Existing Issues:** Search the **[Issues](https://github.com/YourOrganization/hotel-management-system/issues)** to make sure the bug hasn't already been reported.
2.  **Open a New Issue:** If not found, open a new issue and use the "Bug Report" template if one exists.
3.  **Provide Details:**
    * **Environment:** Operating System, Browser, and specific project version/commit.
    * **Steps to Reproduce:** Clear, concise steps that allow anyone to recreate the bug.
    * **Expected Behavior:** What should have happened.
    * **Actual Behavior:** What actually happened.
    * **Screenshots/Logs:** Include relevant screenshots or error logs where applicable.

### ‚ú® Suggesting Features

We love new ideas! If you have a suggestion for improving the HMS:

1.  **Check Existing Issues:** Search the **[Issues](https://github.com/YourOrganization/hotel-management-system/issues)** to ensure the feature hasn't been proposed.
2.  **Open a New Issue:** Open a new issue and use the "Feature Request" template.
3.  **Explain the Value:** Clearly describe the proposed feature and why it would be beneficial to the system (e.g., "This feature will improve guest check-in time by 30%").

### üíª Submitting Code (Pull Requests)

1.  **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear, descriptive commit messages. We recommend using a conventional commit format (e.g., `feat: add room service module` or `fix: correct billing tax calculation`).
2.  **Run Tests:** Ensure all existing tests pass, and write new tests that cover the code you've added or changed.
    ```bash
    # Command to run project tests (e.g., pytest, jest, etc.)
    npm test
    ```
3.  **Push to Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
4.  **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
    * Go to the original `hotel-management-system` repository.
    * Click "New Pull Request."
    * Ensure you are comparing your branch against the project's `main` or `develop` branch.
    * **Write a detailed description:** Explain *what* you changed and *why*. Reference any related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`).
    * Ensure all checkboxes in the PR template are checked (if a template is used).

## Coding Standards

To maintain code quality and consistency:

* **Follow Existing Style:** Adhere to the existing code style, naming conventions, and project structure.
* **Keep PRs Small:** Focus each Pull Request on a single feature or bug fix.
* **Write Tests:** All new features must have comprehensive tests. Bug fixes should include a test that fails without the fix and passes with it.
* **Documentation:** Update documentation (code comments, README, API docs) where necessary.

---

## Review Process

The project maintainers will review your Pull Request. This review may involve:

1.  Suggesting changes or improvements.
2.  Requesting justification for technical decisions.
3.  Running continuous integration (CI) checks.

Once all issues are addressed and the code is approved, a maintainer will merge your changes.

**Thank you for helping us build a better Hotel Management System!**
